Support Ticket Triage Pipeline (Scikit-Learn/Pandas Stack)
This project implements an automated machine learning pipeline to analyze and triage incoming support tickets. By utilizing scikit-learn for modeling and Pandas/NumPy for data handling, the pipeline aims to classify the Category of a ticket (e.g., Billing, Technical) and predict its Priority Score instantly upon arrival.
